#### The aim of the project is to create an encrypted and secured file storage system to transfer files within users in a remote location. This system will require an input that is successfully encrypted using any of the algorithm techniques and store them anywhere. The uploaded file can be downloaded by other users, but to read the data present in it, they have to decrypt the file using the decryption algorithm and the information provided about the file within the users by the owner

# Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install Ruby (preferably, version >= 2.6)
2. [Download](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and install a Nerd Font. Have a look at the [Nerd Font README](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/readme.md) for installation instructions.

    *Note for `iTerm2` users - Please enable the Nerd Font at iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Text > Non-ASCII font > Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.*

    *Note for `HyperJS` users - Please add `"Hack Nerd Font"` Font as an option to `fontFamily` in your `~/.hyper.js` file.*

3. Install the [colorls](https://rubygems.org/gems/colorls/) ruby gem with `gem install colorls`

    *Note for `rbenv` users - In case of load error when using `lc`, please try the below patch.*

    ```sh
    rbenv rehash
    rehash
    ```

4. Enable tab completion for flags by entering following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) :
    ```bash
    source $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/tab_complete.sh
    ```

5. Start using `colorls` :tada:

6. Have a look at [Recommended configurations](#recommended-configurations) and [Custom configurations](#custom-configurations).

# Recommended configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. To add some short command (say, `lc`) with some flag options (say, `-l`, `-A`, `--sd`) by default, add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) :
    ```sh
    alias lc='colorls -lA --sd'
    ```

2. For changing the icon(s) to other unicode icons of choice (select icons from [here](https://nerdfonts.com/)), change the YAML files in a text editor of your choice (say, `subl`)

    ```sh
    subl $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml
    ```

# Custom configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You can overwrite the existing icons and colors mapping by copying the yaml files from `$(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml` into `~/.config/colorls`, and changing them.

- To overwrite color mapping :

  Please have a look at the [list of supported color names](https://github.com/sickill/rainbow#color-list). You may also use a color hex code as long as it is quoted within the YAML file and prefaced with a `#` symbol.

  Let's say that you're using the dark color scheme and would like to change the color of untracked file (`??`) in the `--git-status` flag to yellow. Copy the defaut `dark_colors.yaml` and change it.

  ```sh
  cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/dark_colors.yaml ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml
  ```

  In the `~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml` file, change the color set for `untracked` from `darkorange` to `yellow`, and save the change.

  ```
  untracked: yellow
  ```

  Or, using hex color codes:

  ```
  untracked: '#FFFF00'
  ```

- To overwrite icon mapping :

  Please have a look at the [list of supported icons](https://nerdfonts.com/). Let's say you want to add an icon for swift files. Copy the default `files.yaml` and change it.

  ```sh
  cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/files.yaml ~/.config/colorls/files.yaml`
  ```

  In the `~/.config/colorls/files.yaml` file, add a new icon / change an existing icon, and save the change.


  ```
  swift: "\uF179"
  ```
